### PART 2

## 1. A metric for determining the success of Ultimate's experiment would be the proportion of trips in Ultimate Gotham vs. Metropolis.

## 2a. This experiment could be implemented by offering a statistically significant portion of drivers the promotion and leaving the rest of the 
# drivers with no special promotion to pay their toll expenses. When selecting riders for the promotion, it would be important to select riders who
# are average in terms of their habits and truly random, lest we introduce bias to the experiment.

# 2b. We could could determine if our experiment caused a significant change using a two proportion z test ( assume p1 = p2). This would be done by assuming the null hypothesis (no difference between proportions) is
# true and if our p value exceeds a significance level of 0.05, the alternative hypothesis (the promotion is effective) would be true.

# 3c. If we rejected the null hypothesis, the team's could be considered provisionally effective, and likely in need of another experiment. If the null
# hypothesis was confirmed, it wouldn't necessarily mean the promotion was not effective and the drivers selected for the promotion would need to be examined
# as well as the time period and other external factors to rule out any confounding variables.
